# JokerDisplay - Balatro Mod

Balatro mod that displays information such as modifiers or relevant hands, ranks or suits under Jokers.

## Installation

1. Install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) (version >1.0.0)
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nh6574/JokerDisplay/releases)
3. Extract the zip file into it's own folder inside your Balatro mods folder (%appdata%\Balatro\Mods)

Support for Steamodded <=0.9.8 was dropped in v1.6.1. Please use [version v1.6.0](https://github.com/nh6574/JokerDisplay/releases/tag/v1.6.0) or update to 1.0.0.

## Usage

* Right-click the display or a Joker to hide/unhide displays (or use the back button on your controller over a Joker). This will disable all calculations for that joker (in case of crashes).
* Left-click the display to hide/unhide extra rows of text. (Mouse only)

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/nh6574/JokerDisplay/issues) for suggestions or bug reports.

## Mod Support

This mod only supports vanilla jokers but you can add support for it in your mod by defining how the display should look.

Also I would appreciate if people contact me when there are updates to the game or Steamodded that break any features or add content.

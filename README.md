# JokerDisplay for Balatro

Balatro mod that displays information such as modifiers or relevant hands, ranks or suits under Jokers.

## Installation

1. Install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) [(version >1.0.0)](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki)
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nh6574/JokerDisplay/releases)
3. Extract the zip file into its own folder inside your Balatro mods folder (%appdata%\Balatro\Mods)

## Usage

* Right-click the display or a Joker to hide/unhide displays (or use the back button on your controller over a Joker). This will disable all calculations for that joker (in case of crashes).
* Left-click the display to collapse/expand extra rows of text. (or use the up button on your controller over a Joker).
* Go to Mods > JokerDisplay > Config for more options.

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/nh6574/JokerDisplay/issues) for suggestions or bug reports.
